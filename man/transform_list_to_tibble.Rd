\title{Transform a List into a Tibble}
\usage{
transform_list_to_tibble(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list to transform, which can be:
\itemize{
\item A data frame (returned as tibble)
\item An empty list (returns empty tibble)
\item A named list of atomic values (becomes one row)
\item A list of lists (each sublist becomes a row)
\item A named list with nested structures
}}
}
\value{
A tibble where:
\itemize{
\item Each top-level list element typically becomes a row
\item Nested lists are either flattened into columns or preserved as list-columns
\item NULL values are converted to NA
\item Column names are preserved from list names when available
}
}
\description{
Recursively converts a list or nested list structure into a tibble format,
handling various list structures and edge cases.
}
\note{
This function handles complex nested structures by:
\itemize{
\item Converting consistent nested lists to tibbles
\item Preserving nested data frames as list-columns
\item Creating default names (v1, v2, etc.) for unnamed lists
}
}
