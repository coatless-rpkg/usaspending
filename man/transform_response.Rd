\title{Transform an API Response into a Tibble}
\usage{
transform_response(x, flatten = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An API response object containing either a 'results' field for paginated
responses or direct data fields for non-paginated responses}

\item{flatten}{Logical. If TRUE, attempts to flatten nested data structures within
the response into separate columns. For complex nested structures, some elements
may remain as nested tibbles if they cannot be flattened without data loss.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing:
\itemize{
\item Data from the API response organized in columns
\item Pagination metadata as an attribute (if present in response)
\item API messages as an attribute (if present in response)
}
}
\description{
Converts a USAspending API response into a tibble format, handling both paginated
and non-paginated responses. The function preserves pagination metadata and messages
as attributes in the resulting tibble.
}
\note{
The function automatically handles different response structures:
\itemize{
\item Paginated responses with a 'results' field
\item Non-paginated responses with direct data fields
\item Responses with nested data structures (when flatten = TRUE)
}
}
